- the username and groupname are not used (but need to be)
- the bundle cannot be auto-created as the bundle creation
  script is prompted (or we generate it auto-magically)
- command-line arg verification is not yet implemented


Notes:

- Using the standard /etc/sysconfig/<service> file which defined
  PARAM=VALUE type things may not be such a good plan for convergence.
  i.e if you change the 'httpPort' then you need to redefine the bundle.
  Thus, perhaps, it is better to just re-install with the installer
